# ML Position & Stat Type Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Goalkeepers like Courtois were showing **"Goal Involvement: 2.96"** instead of **"Expected Saves: 2.96"**.

Attackers like Rodrygo were being predicted for **tackles and blocks** instead of **goals and shots**.

### Root Cause
1. **Database positions were incorrect** - Many players had wrong positions (GKs as FWD, Midfielders as DEF)
2. **statType field was incorrect** - Goalkeepers had "Assists" instead of "Saves"
3. **Frontend labels were hardcoded** - Always showed "Goal Involvement" regardless of position

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Position Detection Script (`scripts/fix-positions-smart.ts`)
Created a smart position fixer that:
- **Known Player Database**: Hardcoded positions for 50+ top players (Courtois, Mbappe, etc.)
- **Smart Inference**: For unknown players, uses FIFA stats to infer position:
  - **GK Detection**: Low shooting (<50) + Low pace (<60) = Goalkeeper
  - **FWD Detection**: High shooting (≥75) + High pace (≥70) + Low defending (<65) = Forward
  - **DEF Detection**: High defending (≥75) + Low shooting (<65) = Defender
  - **MID Detection**: Good passing (≥75) or moderate defending (60-75) = Midfielder

### 2. Database Updates
- **Fixed 153 Goalkeepers**: `position: 'GK'`, `statType: 'Saves'`
- **Fixed 106 Defenders**: `position: 'DEF'`, `statType: 'Tackles'`
- **Fixed 463 Midfielders**: `position: 'MID'`, `statType: 'Assists'`
- **Fixed 62 Forwards**: `position: 'FWD'`, `statType: 'Goals'`

### 3. Frontend Dynamic Labels (`client/src/pages/match-detail.tsx`)
Changed hardcoded "Goal Involvement" to dynamic labels based on `statType`:
- **Goals** → "Goal Contribution"
- **Assists** → "Assist Contribution"  
- **Saves** → "Expected Saves"
- **Tackles** → "Expected Tackles"
- **Interceptions** → "Expected Interceptions"

```

## 🎮 User Experience

### Before ❌
- Courtois: "Goal Involvement: 2.96" (confusing!)
- Rodrygo: Predicted for tackles/blocks (wrong!)
- All players: "Goal Involvement" label

### After ✅
- Courtois: "Expected Saves: 2.96" (clear!)
- Rodrygo: Predicted for goals/shots (correct!)
- Dynamic labels: "Expected Saves", "Goal Contribution", "Expected Tackles"

### Position-Specific ML Models
- **Forward Models**: Predict goals, assists, shots, key_passes
- **Midfielder Models**: Predict assists, key_passes, goals, tackles, interceptions
- **Defender Models**: Predict tackles, interceptions, clearances, blocks
- **Goalkeeper Models**: Predict saves, goals_conceded, clean_sheet

### Feature Engineering
Each prediction uses 26 features:
- Player FIFA attributes (7)
- Position encoding (4)
- Team context (4)
- Opposition strength (2)
- Match context (3)
- Recent form (4)

### Probability Calculation
- **Count stats** (goals, assists, tackles, saves): Poisson distribution `P(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-λ)`
- **Binary stats** (clean sheet): Direct probability from model
