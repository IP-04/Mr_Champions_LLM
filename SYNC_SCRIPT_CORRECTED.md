# ✅ Player Sync Script - Corrected Implementation

## What Was Fixed

The sync script has been updated to use the **correct** Playwright scraper implementation matching your working test scripts.

### Before ❌
```typescript
// Used incorrect dataSync service
import { dataSyncService } from "../server/services/dataSync";
await dataSyncService.syncPlayersWithUrls(1);
```

### After ✅
```typescript
// Uses correct Playwright scraper directly
import { sofifaScraper } from "../server/services/sofifaPlaywrightScraper.js";

const playerData = await sofifaScraper.scrapePlayer(player.sofifaUrl);
const radarStats = calculateRadarStats(playerData);
```

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Correct Scraper Import**
```typescript
import { sofifaScraper } from "../server/services/sofifaPlaywrightScraper.js";
```
- Uses the same Playwright scraper as your test scripts
- Direct browser automation (reliable & accurate)

### 2. **Proper Radar Stats Calculation**
```typescript
function calculateRadarStats(playerData: any) {
  return {
    pace: Math.round(((playerData.movement_acceleration || 0) + (playerData.movement_sprint_speed || 0)) / 2),
    shooting: Math.round(((playerData.attacking_finishing || 0) + (playerData.power_shot_power || 0)) / 2),
    passing: Math.round(((playerData.attacking_short_passing || 0) + (playerData.skill_long_passing || 0)) / 2),
    dribbling: Math.round(((playerData.skill_dribbling || 0) + (playerData.skill_ball_control || 0)) / 2),
    defending: Math.round(((playerData.defending_defensive_awareness || 0) + (playerData.defending_standing_tackle || 0)) / 2),
    physical: Math.round(((playerData.power_strength || 0) + (playerData.power_stamina || 0)) / 2),
  };
}
```
- Matches your test-playwright-scraper.ts implementation
- Calculates FIFA 6 main attributes correctly
- Uses detailed stats for accurate ratings

### 3. **Browser Cleanup**
```typescript
finally {
  await sofifaScraper.close();
  console.log('🏁 Browser closed');
}
```
- Always closes Playwright browser after sync
- Prevents resource leaks

### 4. **Correct Imports**
```typescript
import { db } from "../db/index.js";
import { players } from "../shared/schema.js";
import { sofifaScraper } from "../server/services/sofifaPlaywrightScraper.js";
```
- Uses relative imports like other working scripts
- Includes `.js` extensions for ESM compatibility

## Usage (Same as Before)

### Sync Players with Missing Data
```bash
npm run sync-players -- --missing-only --limit 20
```

### Sync Specific Team
```bash
npm run sync-players -- --team "Paris Saint-Germain FC"
```

### Sync First 10 Players
```bash
npm run sync-players -- --limit 10
```

## How It Works

1. **Queries Database** - Gets players that need syncing based on filters
2. **Checks SoFIFA URL** - Skips players without assigned URLs
3. **Playwright Scraping** - Uses headless browser to scrape player page
4. **Calculates Stats** - Derives FIFA 6 attributes from detailed stats
5. **Updates Database** - Saves playerFaceUrl, overall, radarStats, etc.
6. **Rate Limiting** - Waits 3-5s between requests
7. **Browser Cleanup** - Closes Playwright browser

## Compatibility with Your CSV

The script works with players that have `sofifaUrl` populated. To use your CSV file:

### Option 1: Run Existing Import Script
```bash
tsx scripts/assign-sofifa-urls.ts
```
This will read your `sofifa-web-scraper/player_urls.csv` and assign URLs to matching players.

### Option 2: Manual Sync from CSV
If you need a new script that reads directly from CSV:

```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as csv from 'csv-parser';

async function syncFromCSV() {
  const urls: string[] = [];
  
  fs.createReadStream('sofifa-web-scraper/player_urls.csv')
    .pipe(csv())
    .on('data', (row) => urls.push(row.player_url))
    .on('end', async () => {
      for (const url of urls) {
        const playerData = await sofifaScraper.scrapePlayer(url);
        // ... process and save
      }
    });
}
```

---

## Verification

### Test the Script
```bash
# Test with 1 player first
npm run sync-players -- --limit 1

# If successful, try 5 more
npm run sync-players -- --missing-only --limit 5
```

### Check Player in UI
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open match detail page
3. Click on a synced player
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Face image loads
   - ✅ Radar chart shows real stats
   - ✅ Attribute bars are color-coded
   - ✅ Overall rating displays correctly

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No SoFIFA URL found"
**Solution:** Run `tsx scripts/assign-sofifa-urls.ts` first

### Issue: "Failed to scrape data"
**Possible causes:**
- SoFIFA URL format changed
- Network timeout
- Rate limiting (too many requests)

**Solution:** Check player URL manually, adjust rate limiting delay

### Issue: Browser doesn't close
**Solution:** The script now has `finally` block to ensure cleanup
